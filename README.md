# MiniMQ

MiniMQ is a learning project built to understand how message brokers like RabbitMQ work under the hood.  

## Features
- **Producers** that send messages to Exchanges  
- **Exchanges** that route messages to Queues  
- **Queues** that store messages until consumed  
- **Consumers** that process messages from Queues  

This project was developed as a hands-on exercise after attending a workshop on messaging systems. Itâ€™s intended for **educational purposes** and demonstrates the flow of messages in a broker-like environment **without external dependencies or a database**.
